# AWS Lambda Cleanup Module

This Terraform module provisions a scheduled AWS Lambda function that automatically cleans up unused EC2 resources and publishes notifications to SNS.

---

## üöÄ What This Module Does

- Creates an **IAM Role** with permissions to:
  - Describe and terminate EC2 instances
  - Describe and release Elastic IP addresses
  - Describe and delete EBS volumes
  - Write logs to CloudWatch Logs
  - Publish messages to a specified SNS topic
- Deploys a **Python 3.11 Lambda function** (`CleanupUnusedResources`) from a packaged zip file
- Schedules a **weekly CloudWatch Event rule** to trigger the Lambda every Monday at 00:00 UTC
- Grants CloudWatch Events permission to invoke the Lambda function

## üìã Usage Example

```hcl
module "lambda_cleanup" {
  source            = "./modules/lambda_cleanup"
  aws_sns_topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn
  env               = var.env
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- The Lambda function code must be packaged as `function.zip` and placed in the module directory.
- The function runs weekly on Mondays at midnight UTC by default (modifiable via the cron expression).
- The Lambda environment variables include `LOG_LEVEL` and `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` for logging and notifications.
- Make sure the SNS topic exists and the Lambda has permissions to publish to it.

# üåê AWS Client VPN Terraform Module

This Terraform module provisions an **AWS Client VPN Endpoint** and associates it with public and private subnets across availability zones. It uses certificate-based authentication and ACM for secure access.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Creates a **Client VPN Endpoint**
- Uses **ACM-issued certificates** for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication
- Associates VPN endpoint with **public and private subnets**
- Configures **routing** to allow VPN traffic through the subnets
- Adds **authorization rules** to permit access to VPC networks

## üîê Certificate Authentication

This module uses **ACM-issued TLS certificates** for:
- The **server certificate** (`*.devopsguru.world`)
- The **root certificate chain** for client authentication

Make sure:
- The ACM certificate is already **issued and validated**
- You manage client certificates appropriately

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Routing

The module sets up:
- One **VPN route per unique subnet** (both public and private)
- Default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) targeting each associated subnet

---

## ‚úÖ Example Usage

```hcl
module "vpn" {
  source                = "./modules/vpn"
  env                   = var.env
  vpc_id                = "vpc-1234567890abcdef"
  vpc_cidr_block        = "10.0.0.0/16"
  public_subnet_ids     = ["subnet-abc1", "subnet-abc2"]
  private_subnet_ids    = ["subnet-def1", "subnet-def2"]
  vpn_aws_security_group = "sg-0abc12345"
  tags = {
    Project = "VPN Access"
    Owner   = "prod-team"
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure the ACM certificate exists and is in **Issued** status.
- Only **one subnet per AZ** is associated with the VPN (as required by AWS).
- Route authorization is set to allow all groups. You may adjust this for fine-grained control.
